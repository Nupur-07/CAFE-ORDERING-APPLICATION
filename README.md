# Cafe Ordering App
The Cafe Ordering Application project is to design and develop a graphical user interface (GUI)-based desktop application that simulates the experience of a user interacting with a digital ordering system in a caf√© or restaurant setting. The application is developed using Java Swing, a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which provides a rich set of components for building graphical user interfaces.
